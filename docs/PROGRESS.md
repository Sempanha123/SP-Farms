# Progress

## Phase 01 — Repository Bootstrap and Local `.venv`

Status: complete

- Created Python package metadata and the `sp-farms` console entry point.
- Added repository hygiene, local configuration template, and development tooling.
- Added idempotent PowerShell workflows for bootstrap, development, tests, linting, formatting, and packaging.
- Added package, entry-point, bootstrap, and virtual-environment exclusion tests.
- Reused the working repository-local `.venv`; Python 3.12 was detected by the launcher but its installation is unavailable, so local validation uses Python 3.14 while the project targets Python 3.12+.

## Phase 02 — Architecture Boundaries and Application Bootstrap

Status: complete

- Added domain, application, infrastructure, module, plugin, and application packages.
- Added shared result/error types and repository, service, provider, and clock protocols.
- Added the composition root, minimal application context, and idempotent clean shutdown hooks.
- Added architecture boundary, package import, result, bootstrap, and lifecycle tests.
- Documented allowed dependency directions in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Phase 03 — Configuration Logging and Diagnostics

Status: complete

- Added typed, validated non-secret configuration with defaults, TOML files, and environment precedence.
- Added rotating JSON logs, module logger helpers, and automatic sensitive-value redaction.
- Added runtime diagnostics and redacted ZIP support bundles without configuration, vault, or database contents.
- Wired log lifecycle into application composition and documented support workflows.
- Added tests for configuration precedence, rotation, structured output, redaction, and bundle safety.
